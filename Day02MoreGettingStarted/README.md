# Even more getting started

This day is just another tour of what has to come. The author explores concept
like preprocessors directives, functions, parameter and arguments, comments,
pros and cons of using *using* and other basic stuff.

The exercises of this day can be simply compiled via a compiler and its cli.

Example:

```bash
g++ Day02MoreGettingStarted/loves.cpp -o love && ./love && rm ./love # cleanup
```
