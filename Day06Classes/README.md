# Classes

This day covered classes, not so in depth, but still a good tour.

Main points:

-   declaration of a class, its data members and its function members (methods)
-   definition of a class data methods 

    ```
    <return-type> <class-name>::<method-name>(<parameter-list>)
    {
    ...
    }
    ```

-   constructors, destructor (constructors can take parameres, both don't return
    any), a default constructor and destructor are provided by the compiler, but
    when one is provided by the user, wheter is a constructor or destructor,
    it's all up to the user... so pay attention and try to follow this
    [rule](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/rule_of_three)
-   access modifiers
-   accessors methods (getters and setters)
-   inline implementations
-   cpp structures and the differences with class (only the default access
    modifier) and the c compatibility
