# Control flow misc

-   `loop` and `goto` eww
-   `while(<condition>) statement;`
-   `do statement; while(<condition>)`
-   `for(<initialization(s)>; <condition(s)>; <increment(s)>) statement;` and
    all its variant that exclude one or more of the compoent of a `classic` for
    loop (opposed to the foreach for loop that i guess will come later)
-   `continue` and `break`, similar, in a way, to a goto statement, but
    definetly cleaner than that monster
-   switch case

There is also a paragraph on scoping for loops, and nesting loops.
