# Functions

Main topics of this day are functions:

-   function declaration
-   function definition
-   forward declaration to allow the use of a function defined later in code
-   function return type and parameter list
    -   differences between function parameters, which are the "variable names"
        and types a fanction expect, adn function arguments which represents the
        actual "value" passed to a function
-   concept of function signature
-   function overload (different signature on the parameter list)
-   default parameters
-   inline function (just inline substution of code, to use with care)
-   recursion (direct or indirect)
-   brief tour on how the memory actually work and how the processors decides
    which instruction has to be executed and what data has to be "freed" (stack
    memory only)
