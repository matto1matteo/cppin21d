# More on member functions

Key concepts:

-   member functions (methods) overload
-   constructor (which is a method) overload
-   copy constructor
-   operator overload
    
    ```cpp
    <return-type> operator<operator>(<parameters>))
    ```

-   type conversion
    
    ```cpp
    <ClassName>(<type>);
    operator <type>();
    ```
